# BrewFinder 🍻

Welcome to BrewFinder ! This is a React Native application that allows you to explore the world of craft beer.
I have set up this application during my React Native bootcamp organized by [Matthys](https://github.com/MatthysDev) & [David](https://github.com/flexbox)

## 🚀 A few facts about the project...

-   [API OpenFoodFacts 🔗](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/api/v2/) which enabled me to collect data on beers from France, Germany and Belgium.

This application lists all the unimaginable beers produced in 3 European countries 🇫🇷🇩🇪🇧🇪.

**In terms of functionalities :**

-   I was able to set up an **infinite scroll by loading data from 10 beers by 10 beers using React Query** [🔗](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)
-   I also set up a **filter system that changes the API request according to the click on the country flag**.
-   Also, we have a **modal system to learn more about the beer with some data and a button that redirects to the product page on the OpenFoodFacts website**.
